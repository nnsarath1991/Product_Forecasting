# Warehouse Space Allocation Algorithm(greedy approach)

This project is part of my Pro-bono analytics project. We were a team of 4, went on to a NGO, Teacher's Desk - aimed at giving free stationaries to teachers who teach students from under-previleged schools.

Problem:

Cumbersome manual handling of 300 SKUs of stationary collected from Walmart, Staples, 3M and other vendors received in an unorganized Full Truck Load(FTL), since they are donated for free! New products come in every week and there is no system to track products except an in-house warehouse listing software. For a data-geek reading this, read the example : 

What you will do if you receive huge(TB) amounts of unstructured data in Real-Time wihtout having a right-tool in hand, when you are already struggling in processing the last week's unstructured data? 

Problem is clear, to create a system, model it and present it to all the stake-holders - Head, Kids, Abled, and Aged volunteers. 

Solution:

We developed a Warehouse inventory system to arrange the products systematically depeneding upon the dimension, weight and quantity contraints. We named it using the advanced way of naming convention and came up with a greedy algorithm to allocate the right product at the right space at the right time.
